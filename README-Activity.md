# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, I reviewed all of the Kickstarter Campaigns and analyized
their Funding outcomes by their launch dates and campaign goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the correlation of these two
parameters together made a difference in the outcome of the funding Campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenges to this analysis, is that there isn't that many theaters that
produce plays on a regular basis with a large amount of patrons.  Large cities
can reign in large crowds and produce and fund quite large Kickstarter campaigns
while smaller towns are limited to a much, much smaller budget.  This makes
calculating the goals and pledges hard to group together when analyzing.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The outcomes were definitely apparent in this area of analysis. Cancellations are 
very low for plays, so this is a good sign.  In all areas of Kickstarter
campaigns, plays do well overall and succeed every month more than they fail.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The outcomes fluctuated with the success and failure based on the goals for 
funding.  Lower priced plays with goals of under $20,000 seemed to reach their
goal. The closer they came to $20,000 and above the more risk of failure they
became.  There was a sweet spot around the $35,000 to $45,000 range that
seemed to succeed, but I do feel that is more for a larger city than a rural
town.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Data Analysis does leave out details of who the playwright is, and are they 
well known, do they have a large following, or large private financial backer.
These items will skew any analysis, and those can be in the dataset.  Some
of these failures could also be due to reasons beyond the persons control, and
they didn't want to cancel it and their financial backers failed to come through
at the last minute. 

## Results

- Based on what I observed, the best month to kick off your campaign is 
definitely May, with the number succeeding was 111 to only 52 failing, so more
than double. You definitely want to choose this, even if you have to wait
6 months or more to start.

- Second to that is February, where the number succeeding was 71 to 39 failing, 
was almost double in the success column.  If you can't start in May, then I 
would recommend you to start your kick off campaign in February.

- The data set I used definitely gave me hope for your play to succeed with
a Kickstarter Campaign. Having a $10,000 budget fell within the successful
area of campaigns. It was just under 50% but it was definitely more than the
failures. So working with other local artisans that can also help with the
play and promote the campaign as well as a member of the campaign can 
potentially lower your costs and increase your exposure to patrons.

- The data set had some limitations, in which, I could not determine if this
play was for a community theater, a traveling theater group with a group of
artisans for the summer or for a play trying to make it on Broadway.  There
was no indication if the playwright was presenting their first play, or
hoping to produce their very first or their 100th play.   These factors will
definitely change the chances of the success or failure of the outcome.

- The data set had some other options we could analyze to see if it made a
difference in the success or failure of the campaign.  

-- We could definitely could have seen the progression of success or failure 
over the years.  This could tell us if in certain years how plays have done.  
The trend could be going up or down, due to economic issues or world events 
during that time.

-- We could analyze how the the plays that the staff picked did, the organization
that kept up with this data, had their favorites, so it would be curious
to see how their favorites actually faired during their kickstarter campaign.

-- We could look at the success and failure of the campaigns by the number of
backers.  It would be curious to know if the ones with the most backers 
succeeded or failed.
